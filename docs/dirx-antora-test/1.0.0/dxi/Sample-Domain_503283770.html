<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The My-Company sample domain is a realistic scenario of a small company that demonstrates most of the features that DirX Identity provides. It comprises many DirX Identity objects, such as users, departments, privileges, policies, request workflows and target systems. The My-Company sample domain is designed to be the basis for the quick start tutorial. You can select the My-Company sample domain during DirX Identity configuration. You can also load the Connectivity scenarios that correspond to the My-Company domain by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My-Company represents a small, international industrial company called My-Company in a business-to-business (B2B) scenario, where additional companies act as customers and suppliers. My-Company designs and produces hardware and software products made available to end customers through re-seller companies who buy My-Company&#8217;s products and sell them in their malls and stores. Supplier companies deliver the hardware and software that My-Company needs in order to build its products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter describes the objects in the My-Company sample domain and the relationships between them. We recommend that you read the descriptions given here while you look up the objects in the DirX Identity views.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="SampleDomain-LoggingIn"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-LoggingIn"></a>Logging In</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To log in to the My-Company domain, follow the procedure described in "Logging In" in the "Getting Started" chapter.</p>

<h3 id="SampleDomain-Users"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Users"></a>Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the <strong>Users</strong> view. For the sample domain, this view presents a directory tree organized into user subtrees for three companies: Customers, Suppliers, and the employees of My-Company. The user tree also contains the standard query folders provided for the user view and a System folder that is not currently used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The companies that make up the sample domain scenario are distributed throughout Europe and the U.S.A., as illustrated in the following figure.</p>

<p>Open the My-Company subtree to see the organizational units that My-Company contains. In the sample domain scenario, organizational units are designed as tree objects. Also check the content and structure of the departments that are either lower-level organizational units or user entries. The organizational units are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>

<h4 id="SampleDomain-UserProperties"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-UserProperties"></a>User Properties</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click a user in one of My-Company&#8217;s departments. You&#8217;ll see two rows of tabs that group different user properties and attributes according to their functions. These tabs and fields represent the default user definition for the My-Company sample domain. This user definition has been designed to provide a comprehensive set of user properties and attributes that you are, with some exceptions, allowed to change or even remove from the user definition if they do not meet your needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default user definition is modeled as a set of object descriptions in XML. The definitions of user properties and attributes that you are not allowed to modify or delete can be found in the <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> view at <strong>My-Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Object</strong> <strong>Descriptions</strong> &#8594; <strong>User.xml</strong>. If you go to <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Extensions</strong> &#8594; <strong>Object</strong> <strong>Descriptions</strong>, you will find two default object description files: <strong>UserCommon.xml</strong> and <strong>User.xml</strong>. As delivered with DirX Identity, <strong>User.xml</strong> is empty and is intended for your use. <strong>UserCommon.xml</strong> contains the sample set of user properties and attributes that you can modify or delete as necessary. You can also use the object description paradigm to create your own custom user object descriptions. For example, you may want to define several different user types that display different properties and attributes depending on the type of user, such as "internal" user and "contractor". For more information about object descriptions and how to work with them, see the section on "Customizing Objects" in the <em>DirX Identity Customization Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next sections briefly describe the user properties and attributes provided with the default user definition for the My-Company sample domain and gives some hints on what you can do with them. The context-sensitive help available on each tab (just click <strong>Help</strong>) provides complete details on each field.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="SampleDomain-GeneralUserProperties"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-GeneralUserProperties"></a>General User Properties</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The General tab contains properties that identify the user. The My-Company sample domain uses the following properties in this tab:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "name" properties <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>First Name, Middle Name, Last</strong> <strong>Name</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Salutation</strong> (the sample domain supplies salutations in a variety of languages), <strong>Day of Birth</strong>, <strong>Title</strong> (for example, <strong>Dr.</strong>) and <strong>Gender</strong> (the sample domain supplies the selections <strong>Male</strong>, <strong>Female</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "identifier" properties <strong>Employee Number</strong> and <strong>Master</strong>. <strong>Employee Number</strong> (employeeNumber) <strong> is a customer-specific identifier that comes, for example, from a human resources system. <strong>Master</strong> (dxmOprMaster) is a directory-specific value that identifies the source of the user entry (it is the connected directory&#8217;s <strong>Master Name</strong> operational attribute, written to the user entry by the connected directory&#8217;s source workflow). This feature is intended for use in multiple master scenarios to protect user entries mastered by one directory source from being created or deleted by another master (modification by different masters is permitted).<br>
<br>
The My-Company domain has two sources of user entries: the HR-ODBC connected directory (which is already set up in the sample Connectivity scenario delivered with the sample domain), and the New-HR connected directory, which is set up as part of the tutorial exercise "Importing Identities" in the "Getting Started" section of the guide. The source workflows for these two directories are configured to use the <strong>Master Name</strong> operational attributes (the <strong>Use Operational Attributes</strong> field is checked in the workflow configurations). As a result, a user in the My-Company sample domain will either have the value <strong>HR</strong> to indicate that the HR-ODBC directory is the source of the entry, or the value <strong>NEWHR</strong>, which indicates that the New-HR directory is the source.<br>
<br>
All of the default connected directories provided with DirX Identity have their <strong>Master Name</strong> operational attribute set to <strong>HR</strong>. If you intend to set up a multi-master scenario and use one or more of the default connected directories as templates, you should make sure you assign a different <strong>Master Name</strong> to your different master connected directories and set the <strong>Use Operational Attributes</strong> flag in the source workflows for these connected directories. For more information on creating connected directories, see "Managing Connected Directories" in the </strong> <em>DirX Identity Connectivity Administration Guide</em>. For more information on source workflows, see the section "Using the Source Workflows" in the ** <em>DirX Identity Connectivity Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description,</strong> which briefly describes the person&#8217;s tasks. A description is useful for providing a human-readable way to identify a user when it is part of an extensive table-based display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Type</strong> (<strong>employeeType</strong>), which can be used to classify users. The My-Company sample domain defines the following employee types:<br>
<br>
<strong>Internal</strong> - all employees of My-Company<br>
<strong>Contractor</strong> - all contractors that work for My-Company<br>
<strong>Customers</strong> - customers of My-Company<br>
<strong>Suppliers</strong> - suppliers of My-Company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Category</strong>, which identifies the type of business the user works for. The My-Company sample domain defines business categories for <strong>Banking</strong>, <strong>Energy</strong>, <strong>Healthcare</strong>, <strong>Industry</strong>, <strong>Real</strong> <strong>Estate</strong>, and <strong>Transportation</strong>. It assigns <strong>Industry</strong> to the My-Company employees, but does not assign a business category to employees in Customers and Suppliers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default General user properties tab also provides an <strong>Identifier</strong> property (dxmGUID) that customers can use to set up a global unique identifier (GUID) for each user. To use this property, the customer designs a unique identifier schema and then writes its own GUID generator to create the GUIDs according to the schema. The default connected directories delivered with DirX Identity implement a sample GUID schema and generator that generates a local GUID for a user from a fixed string prefix configured in each connected directory and the user&#8217;s Employee Number, if the feature is activated in the corresponding source workflows. For more information, see the context-sensitive help on connected directories and workflows and the section "Understanding the Tcl-based Source Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em>. The My-Company sample domain does not use the <strong>Identifier</strong> property.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="SampleDomain-RelationshipstoOtherUsers"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-RelationshipstoOtherUsers"></a>Relationships to Other Users</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Relationships</strong> tab specifies the relationships that a user has to other users. The My-Company sample domain defines five types of user-to-user relationship:</p>

<p>Owner - the administrator who can manage this user, or the person responsible for this user, if it is a functional user, for example, the representation of a hotline or a service. My-Company does not use this field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manager - the user&#8217;s manager; the My-Company sample domain uses this relationship for its Internal employee types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secretary - the user&#8217;s secretary or administrative assistant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representative - the user&#8217;s representative; that is, the person who can perform the user&#8217;s functions if he or she is unavailable</p>

<p>The values specified in these fields are links to other users. To see an example of this setup, go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Human</strong> <strong>Resources</strong> and then click on <strong>Berner</strong> <strong>Hans</strong>, the manager of the Human Resources department. You can see that he has a Manager link (Olivier Hungs, who is the manager of My-Company), a Secretary link (Laura Telfer) and a Representative link (Mary-Jane Ormsby), but no Sponsor link because he is not a contractor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now click on <strong>Strober</strong> <strong>Santiago</strong>. His Manager is Olivier Hungs and his Sponsor is Hans Berner. Although Santiago Strober reports to Olivier Hungs the general manager and not to a department manager, he needs to have a department sponsor because My-Company contractors are required to have sponsors in their functional areas. Because he currently works in Human Resources, he is assigned the sponsor Hans Berner, the HR manager. This example demonstrates that you can set up any kind of relationship hierarchy, not just one that follows your managerial hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These relationships can be useful in, for example, approval workflows to dynamically search for specific persons. For example, you could set up an approval workflow that searches for both the user and the user&#8217;s representative so that you have both persons in your approval activity. If the user is not available, the representative has the right to approve. For more information on user-to-user linking, see the section "Working with Links at User Entries" in the section "Managing Users" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use the relationships between users in conjunction with variable substitution to implement dynamic participant calculation in your request workflows. For more information about this concept, see the section "Participant Calculation" in the path "Understanding the Default Application Workflow Technology" &#8594; "Understanding Request Workflows" &#8594; "Customizing Request Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em>.</p>

<p>This tab also specifies the user&#8217;s preferred language, which determines the language used in mail messages delivered by request workflows, if mail text in that language has been set up. The My-Company domain has set up English and German for request workflow mail messages. All users in My-Company have a preferred Language set. If this is one of English or German, the mail is sent in that language. Otherwise the respective default values are taken. The users in Suppliers and Customers do not have any preferred language set, so mail messages they receive from request workflows will be sent in the default language.

<p>The <strong>Organization</strong> tab displays the user&#8217;s links to business objects modeled as organizations and organizational units. The companies that make up the sample domain have been structured as organization business objects and the My-Company departments have been structured as organizational units underneath the My-Company organization. See the "Companies" section in "Business Objects" for more information about these objects and how they are structured and used. The users in the My-Company part of the sample domain are linked to the My-Company organization business object and the organizational business unit that corresponds to the department in which they work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand this relationship, let&#8217;s look at a user. Go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Human</strong> <strong>Resources</strong> and click on <strong>Berner</strong> <strong>Hans</strong>, the manager of the Human Resources department. Click the <strong>Organization</strong> tab.

In <strong>Organizational</strong> <strong>Unit</strong>, he has a link to the organizational unit that represents <strong>Human</strong> <strong>Resources</strong>, which is the department in which he works. The other users in the My-Company part of the user tree have similar assignments. The organization and organizational business objects set up for the My-Company users are used to master department-specific information and to automatically assign department-specific roles to each member of a department.

Click the <strong>Location</strong> tab. In the <strong>Location</strong> field, you can see that he has a link to the business object that represents My-Company&#8217;s main office of its Human Resources department: My-Company Munich (if you click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/502693970.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/502693970"></span> icon to the right of <strong>Location</strong> , the <strong>My-Company Munich</strong> business object is displayed).</p>

<li>
<p>Go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Finances</strong> and then click <strong>Dalmar</strong> <strong>Christopher</strong>. Now click his <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> tab. Here you can see the different ways in which privileges can be assigned to users:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By hand (through self service or administrator action) - an administrator or Dalmar himself has assigned the roles <strong>Manager</strong>, <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>, <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong>, and <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong>. The <strong>manual</strong> label in the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>by</strong> field indicates this "direct" type of assignment. You can read more about the My-Company sample domain&#8217;s privilege structure in the section "Privileges". <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> and <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> are examples of privileges that use role parameters, as indicated by the <strong>Role</strong> <strong>parameters</strong> column. You can read more about the My-Company sample domain&#8217;s use of role parameters in the section "Project Organization".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By inheritance from a business object - Dalmar has inherited the <strong>Finances</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> role from his link to the <strong>Finances</strong> business object, which references this role. To see this relationship, click his <strong>Organization</strong> tab and then click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/502792243.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/502792243"></span> icon to the right of <strong>Organizational</strong> <strong>Units</strong>: <strong>Finances</strong>. This action displays the <strong>Finances</strong> business object. Now click the <strong>References</strong> tab, and you can see <strong>Finances</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> displayed in <strong>Privileges</strong>. The <strong>BO</strong> label in the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>by</strong> field indicates this type of assignment. You can read more about the My-Company sample domain&#8217;s business object structure in the section "Business Objects".<br>
<br>
Note that the <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong> role assignment also uses inheritance, in this case, by role hierarchy: the Signature Level 2 role is a junior role for <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong>. To see this relationship, click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/502693974.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/502693974"></span> icon to the right of this role, and then click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/503218254.gif" alt="/503283770/503218254"></span> icon to the right of <strong>Privileges</strong>: <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong> to open this role. Now click <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Junior</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> and you can see <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>2</strong>. Because this role is specified as a junior role, a user who gets the <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong> role automatically gets this one, too. For information about creating role hierarchies, see the subsection "Creating a Role Hierarchy" in the section "Managing Roles" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By a provisioning rule - My-Company&#8217;s <strong>Internal Employees</strong> rule assigns the <strong>Internal</strong> <strong>Employee</strong> role to all users under the My-Company user subtree whose <strong>Employee</strong> <strong>Type</strong> field (see the <strong>General</strong> tab) is set to <strong>Internal</strong>. The <strong>rule</strong> label in the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>by</strong> field indicates this type of assignment.

In the <strong>Privileges</strong> field, you can see that this business object is linked to the <strong>Finances</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> role in the Corporate Role tree. To find this role, click <strong>Privileges</strong> &#8594; <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong>&#8594; <strong>Department</strong> <strong>Specific</strong>. The other department business objects are set up in a similar way: each department business object is linked to one or more roles that are relevant to this department, as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

</li>
<li>
<p>General Management has no links to privileges</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each My-Company user is linked to a "department" (organizational unit) business object and thus automatically inherits the role that is linked to this object. For example, go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Sales</strong> and then open <strong>Klarmann Bruno</strong>. Click the <strong>Organization</strong> tab. You can see that this user belongs to the organizational unit <strong>Sales</strong>. If you click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/503316578.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/503316578"></span> icon to the right of the <strong>Organizational Unit</strong> field, the <strong>Sales</strong> business object is displayed. Click the <strong>References</strong> tab, and you can see that the role <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> is linked to this business object. Click <strong>Close</strong> and then click the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> tab. You can see <strong>Sales Tasks</strong> listed as an assigned role, and the <strong>Assigned by</strong> field indicates that the role has been assigned by a business object (<strong>BO</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you change a user&#8217;s organizational unit, DirX Identity automatically unassigns the obsolete privileges and assigns the new ones that are relevant to his new organizational unit. For example, return to the <strong>Organization</strong> tab for <strong>Klarmann Bruno</strong> and then click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/503218250.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/503218250"></span> icon to the right of the <strong>Organization</strong> field. The <strong>Companies</strong> business object tree is displayed. Select <strong>Marketing</strong> to move the user to the Marketing organization, and then click <strong>Save</strong>. This action automatically removes the Sales Tasks role and assigns the Marketing Tasks role to the user. Conversely, if you change the privileges that are linked to a business object or make changes to the linked privileges themselves, all users linked to the business object will automatically be updated with the new privilege assignments and/or the updated privilege.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that changing a user&#8217;s organizational unit means changing his link to an OU business object in the Business Objects tree. Moving a user from one department to another in the Users tree has no effect; for example, if you move <strong>Klarmann Bruno</strong> from the <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Sales</strong> - &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Europe</strong> node to the <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Marketing</strong> node, he remains linked to the Sales department until you change this business object link. The sample domain has set up the My-Company User tree to mirror the structure of the Business Object tree, but any kind of Users tree structure is permissible. For example, you may want to create an "administrative area" structure, where users are grouped according to the administrator who is responsible for managing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the <strong>Companies</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> "department" organizational unit business objects use only the privileges link, it is also possible to link business objects to other items, such as locations, cost units, categories, and contexts. If you want to create category or context objects, you must create them under the <strong>Custom</strong> node in the <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Object</strong> tree. For more information about business objects, see "Managing Business Objects" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="SampleDomain-Countries"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Countries"></a>Countries</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the <strong>Countries</strong> node in the <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Objects</strong> tree. You can see subfolders for each country in which My-Company, its customers and its suppliers are located: <strong>CA</strong> (Canada), <strong>DE</strong> (Germany), <strong>ES</strong> (Spain), <strong>FR</strong> (France), <strong>GB</strong> (England), <strong>IT</strong> (Italy), <strong>US</strong> (USA). These subfolders represent country business object types. Each country subfolder in turn contains subfolders for company branch locations - for example, My-Company Paris (FR), My-Company Barcelona (ES), MediaComp Madrid (ES) and so on. These subfolders represent location business object types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The objects in the <strong>Countries</strong> folder demonstrate the inheritance of business object data into user attributes and serve as samples for data inheritance. The business object is linked to the user object and masters the business data. If you change the business object linked to the user (because, for example, the user moves to a different branch office), the user data is automatically updated with the information from the currently linked business object. This update is performed immediately during the save operation. Likewise, if you change data at the business object (for example, the branch office street address), the change is propagated to all users linked to this object. This update runs in the background and can take some time to take effect, especially when the number of assigned users is high.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the sample domain, each user is linked to a location business object and thus automatically inherits the location information in this object. For example, open <strong>Countries</strong> &#8594; <strong>DE</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> <strong>Munich</strong> and look at the postal code, street and address information there. Now go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Finances</strong> and open <strong>Abele</strong> <strong>Marc</strong>. Click the <strong>Location</strong> tab. You can see that this user belongs to <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> <strong>Munich</strong> and has the same information in his postal code, street and postal address attributes. If you click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/503316582.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/503316582"></span> icon to the right of the <strong>Location</strong> field, the <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> <strong>Munich</strong> business object is displayed showing this same information.

The <strong>Countries</strong> business object tree is displayed. Select <strong>My-Company Berlin</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>. Now you can see that Marc Abele&#8217;s postal code, street and postal address information has changed to reflect the <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> <strong>Berlin</strong> location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that if you save this change (by clicking <strong>Save</strong>), an approval workflow is automatically started. This action occurs because there is an attribute access policy for My-Company users that protects against changing locations and organizations without manager approval (you can read more about this policy in "Attribute Policies") and the domain-level flag to enable this type of workflow is set (see the "Request Workflow Parameters" section in "Domain Configuration" for details).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The My-Company sample domain also contains a sample JavaScript routine in its user object description that calculates the user&#8217;s country information from the value in his Location field (dxrLocationLink).

<h4 id="SampleDomain-Projects"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Projects"></a>Projects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the <strong>Projects</strong> node in the <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Objects</strong> tree. You can see three subfolders that correspond to the three optimization projects that My-Company runs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HighPerformance</strong> - a project for general internal process enhancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OptimizeIT</strong> - a project for better IT structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MoreCustomers</strong> - a project to enhance sales and marketing activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These subfolders represent project business object types. My-Company&#8217;s project organization uses these business objects as the source for role parameters in user-project assignment: there is a <strong>Project</strong> role parameter that references these business objects, and there are <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> and <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> roles that use this role parameter:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To view the role parameter, click <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Extensions</strong> &#8594; <strong>RoleParams</strong> &#8594; <strong>My-Company</strong> and open the <strong>Project</strong> role parameter. This parameter has been created to list all business objects in the <strong>Project</strong> tree for selection during a role assignment. If you look at the <strong>DN</strong> area in the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can see that it links to the <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Objects</strong> &#8594; <strong>Projects</strong> tree, and will thus display all business objects contained in this tree in a drop-down list (in Web Center and DirX Identity Manager) when a role that uses this role parameter is assigned to a user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view the roles, go to <strong>Privileges</strong> &#8594; <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles &#8594; Project Specific</strong>. Open <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> and then click the <strong>Role</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab. If you place your cursor over the <strong>Project</strong> column, you can see that it points to the <strong>Project</strong> role parameter (the Tool Tip shows the role parameter&#8217;s distinguished name (DN).). Consequently, when someone assigns this role to a user, he is asked (via drop-down list) which project the role is for - HighPerformance, OptimizeIT or MoreCustomers - the values that come from the Projects business objects tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sample domain illustrates how to use business objects to populate role parameter selections; you can also use them to build proposal lists. You can also associate a proposal list with a role parameter to create one list (using business objects or other objects as a source) that you can use for both role parameter selection and drop-down proposal lists.

<h3 id="SampleDomain-Privileges"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Privileges"></a>Privileges</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The My-Company sample domain contains a set of sample privileges that allow for provisioning of the users in the related target systems structured into a folder hierarchy based first on privilege type, and then on categories of privilege that correspond to My-Company&#8217;s business structure. Click the <strong>Privileges</strong> view. You will see <strong>Roles</strong>, <strong>Permissions</strong> and <strong>Groups</strong> folders. The next sections provide more information on how these folders are organized.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="SampleDomain-Roles"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Roles"></a>Roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Roles</strong> subtree is subdivided into a <strong>B2B Roles</strong> subtree and a <strong>Corporate Roles</strong> subtree. The B2B Roles subtree contains all roles for customers and suppliers, while the <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> subtree contains all roles for the My-Company employees and contractors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are six <strong>Customer</strong> roles: all customers are classified as <strong>Silver</strong> <strong>Customers</strong>. Some are <strong>Gold</strong> <strong>Customers</strong> and only a few are <strong>Platinum</strong> <strong>Customers</strong>. These classes determine the bonus program. Another set of roles defines the services a customer can subscribe to: <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Newsletter</strong>, <strong>Hardware</strong> <strong>Beta</strong> <strong>Programs</strong> and <strong>Software</strong> <strong>Beta</strong> <strong>Programs</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supplier roles include a <strong>Standard</strong> <strong>Class</strong> for each supplier and, for suppliers that perform very well, a <strong>First</strong> <strong>Class</strong> role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> subtree contains another six folders. A collection of all administrative roles makes up the <strong>Administration</strong> folder. The <strong>Department</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> roles folder contains all roles that define tasks for the various organizations in My-Company. The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> roles folder collects all roles necessary for project management. The <strong>Physical</strong> <strong>Access</strong> folder contains all roles that pertain to granting access to secured computer rooms in several My-Company branches. The <strong>Self</strong>-<strong>Service</strong> folder contains all roles that users can assign themselves via user self-service subscription. All other roles are collected under the <strong>General</strong> folder. Within this folder is a very complex role - <strong>Cost</strong> <strong>Location</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> - that is part of a specific use case; to read more about this example, see the section "Policies for Hierarchical Role Parameters" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sample domain&#8217;s privilege structure demonstrates how to group privileges so that access policies can easily be applied to them. For example, the <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Self</strong> <strong>Service</strong> folder contains all of the roles that users can assign to themselves with Web Center self service. Now go to <strong>Policies</strong> &#8594; <strong>Access</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Grant</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> and then click on <strong>Self</strong> <strong>Service</strong>. This access policy controls which users (in this case, users with the employeeType "Internal") can assign to themselves these roles with self service. If you click the <strong>Resources</strong> tab and look at the <strong>Resources filter</strong> values, you can see that the policy directs DirX Identity to apply this policy to the roles in the <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Self</strong> <strong>Service</strong> folder. If you subsequently add a new role to this folder, the Self Service access policy is automatically applied to it. If you look at the <strong>Resources</strong> field, you can see additional physical access roles listed here. As a result, the policy will be applied to these roles explicitly, but any new role added to the physical access folder will not have the policy applied to it. So the sample domain&#8217;s privilege structure shows, too, that you can keep privileges segregated from access policies and add them as necessary. You can read more about access policies in "Access Policies".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sample domain also structures privileges that use role parameters into a separate tree; this is the <strong>Project Specific</strong> tree underneath <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong>. You can read more about how role parameters are used in the My-Company sample domain in the section "Project Organization".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, role managers are free to structure their privileges as they like. The My-Company domain is only an example of a privilege structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now click a role, and then click the <strong>Assigned Permissions</strong> tab to view the attached permissions of the role. In the sample domain, the permissions are almost always symmetrical to the roles, which mean that each permission has exactly one corresponding role, with the following exceptions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Contractor</strong> role consists of the <strong>Contractor</strong> permission and the <strong>Restricted File Share</strong> permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Internal Employee</strong> role uses the <strong>Internal Employee</strong>, the <strong>Group File Share</strong>, the <strong>Standard Tools</strong> and the <strong>Accounting</strong> permissions. This is an example of a complex role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Manager</strong> role is a combination of the <strong>Manager</strong> permission and the <strong>Signature Level 2</strong> permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Training Manager</strong> role consists of the <strong>Manager</strong> and the <strong>Trainer</strong> permissions. The <strong>Trainer</strong> permission is inherited from the assigned <strong>Trainer</strong> junior role (check the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Junior</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> tab). The <strong>Trainer</strong> value in the <strong>Source</strong> column in the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Permissions</strong> tab indicates this role hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>SW</strong> <strong>Developer</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> and <strong>HW</strong> <strong>Developer</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> roles (these are department-specific roles) have a combination of a common <strong>Development</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> permission and a hardware or software-specific permission (SW Developer or HW Developer). The <strong>SW</strong> <strong>Developer</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> role also includes a <strong>RACF</strong> <strong>Standard</strong> permission that allows membership in standard RACF groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Test</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> role (another department-specific role) has the <strong>Test</strong> <strong>Tasks</strong> and <strong>RACF</strong> <strong>Standard</strong> permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>MVS</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong> role (in Administration) has the <strong>MVS</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong> and <strong>RACF Standard</strong> permissions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click a role, and then click the <strong>Users</strong> tab to see who is assigned to the role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>3</strong> role provides another example of a role hierarchy. Click this role in the <strong>General</strong> folder. It contains the <strong>Signature Level 2</strong> role as a junior role (click the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Junior Roles</strong> tab). This means that an assignment of the <strong>Signature Level 3</strong> role includes the automatic assignment of the <strong>Signature Level 2</strong> role. You can also see that the <strong>Signature Level 2</strong> role is used by a senior role if you click the <strong>Senior Roles</strong> tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The roles in the <strong>Physical</strong> <strong>Access</strong> folder are examples of roles that are designed to be assigned manually. The follow-on tutorial "Using Manual Provisioning" demonstrates the use case for these roles. They are also examples of roles that are assigned via provisioning rules; which are described in more detail in the section on "Rules".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the following roles are set to <strong>Requires approval</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All of the administrator roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the physical access roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general roles <strong>Manager</strong>, <strong>Signature Level 3</strong> and <strong>Trainer</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project-specific role <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The self-service roles <strong>Manager</strong> <strong>Analyst</strong> <strong>Relations</strong>, <strong>Parking</strong> <strong>Place</strong> - <strong>Munich</strong> and <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Card</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the <strong>Manager</strong> role, and then click the <strong>Approvals</strong> tab. Here you can see that the <strong>Manager</strong> <strong>Nomination</strong> workflow has been directly assigned to process the approval of assignments of this role to users. This is an example of direct workflow selection, where the workflow is directly linked to the privilege. The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> role also has a direct assignment to the <strong>Manager</strong> <strong>Nomination</strong> approval workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the icon to the right of the <strong>Assignment</strong> field to display the <strong>Manager</strong> <strong>Nomination</strong> workflow. Now double-click the <strong>Approval</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Company</strong> <strong>Head</strong> activity icon and then click the <strong>Participants</strong> tab. Here you can see that the general manager Olivier Hungs and his secretary Gabriela Morton have been explicitly specified as approvers (only one must approve). This is an example of a static participant definition. For more information about participant calculation, including how to use variable substitution and user attributes to create dynamic approval definitions, see the subsection "Participant Calculation" in the path "Understanding Request Workflows" &#8594;"Customizing Request Workflows" &#8594; "Using Variable Substitution" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other roles that require approval do not use direct workflow assignment. Instead, they use rule-based workflow selection and configure the "When Applicable" rules in the My-Company approval workflow definitions so that DirX Identity&#8217;s dynamic workflow selection algorithm always selects the <strong>4-Eye Approval</strong> workflow to process approvals for these roles. For example, go to the My-Company workflow definitions (<strong>Workflows</strong> &#8594; <strong>Workflows</strong> &#8594; <strong>Definitions</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Approval</strong>). Open the <strong>4-Eye Approval</strong> workflow and then look at its <strong>When Applicable</strong> tab. The <strong>Priority</strong> parameter is set to a high number so that the selection algorithm will choose it first. If you look at the <strong>When</strong> <strong>Applicable</strong> tab of the other workflows - for example, the Manager Nomination workflow - you can see that the priorities are set very low to prevent them from being selected. The <strong>4-Eye Approval</strong> workflow works with approval policies to retrieve the manager of the user (the subject) and the owner of the privilege as approvers. Both of these users must approve the assignment.</p>

<h4 id="SampleDomain-Permissions"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-Permissions"></a>Permissions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Permissions</strong> subtree is subdivided into the same folders as the role subtree. It contains a <strong>B2B Permissions</strong> subtree and a <strong>Corporate Permissions</strong> subtree. The <strong>B2B</strong> <strong>Permissions</strong> subtree contains all permissions for customers and suppliers, while the <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Permissions</strong> subtree contains all permissions for the My-Company employees and contractors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click a permission, and then click the <strong>Assigned Groups</strong> tab to view the attached groups. Most of the permissions use groups in a direct relationship, but some permissions use match rules to select some of the attached groups:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Windows Administrator</strong> permission uses two <strong>Administrator</strong> groups from the Windows target systems. The match rule selects the correct group based on the country attribute (c) of the user. View the groups to see the corresponding settings for the c attribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>HR Tasks</strong> permission contains four groups. The <strong>HR</strong> <strong>Access</strong> and <strong>HR</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> groups are always assigned (the country attribute is set to "<strong>"), the *SAP</strong> <strong>R3</strong> <strong>Client</strong> group is selected via the match rule. The <strong>Marketing Tasks</strong> permission structure is similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Sales Task</strong> permission is more complex. The <strong>CRM</strong> <strong>Access</strong> and <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> groups are always assigned (the country attribute is set to "<strong>"), the *SAP</strong> <strong>R3</strong> <strong>Client</strong> and <strong>FS</strong> <strong>Sales</strong> group are selected via the match rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Group File Share</strong> permission is the most complex. It represents a combined access right that allows access to the department-specific file share (attribute ou). It also selects the correct file share based on the country in which the employee resides (attribute c). See the <strong>Match</strong> <strong>Rule</strong> tab for the rule. In the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Groups</strong> tab, you will see nine file share groups. Only <strong>FS</strong> <strong>Human</strong> <strong>Resources</strong> and <strong>FS</strong> <strong>Sales</strong> are available in Europe and the USA. View the groups for the corresponding settings of the c and ou attributes.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong><em>Queries</strong> subtree, which provides a set of default query folders for checking on active and inactive policies, operations, rules and delegations. For more information about queries, see the section "Creating a Query Folder" in the _DirX Identity Customization Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Policies</strong> subtree, which consists of a <strong><em>Queries</strong> folder and a set of folders for Access Policies, Attribute Policies, Delete Policies, Event Policies, Operations, Password Policies, Rules and SoD Policies. Each of these subfolders contains a set of default policies and rules and a set of sample domain-specific policies in the folder My-Company. The next sections describe these folders in more detail. The <strong>_Queries</strong> folder provides a set of default query folders for checking on active and inactive policies, operations, rules and delegations. For more information about queries, see the section "Creating a Query Folder" in the _DirX Identity Customization Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Delegations</strong> subtree, which is initially empty and is the container for objects that relate to delegated administration based on access policies: the process of assigning one&#8217;s access rights to DirX Identity data (or a subset of these rights) to someone else, optionally for a specified period of time. An administrator can delegate the access rights he has to manage users and privileges, assign privileges to users or approve requests for privilege assignments to another user or administrator via the DirX Identity Web Center. For more information, see the section "Delegated Administration" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the sample domain-specific access policies are all delegatable to other users (their <strong>Is</strong> <strong>delegatable</strong> flag is checked), while the default access policies are initially not delegatable. The reason for this setup is that delegation impacts DirX Identity performance when it must retrieve a large number of delegatable resources. The sample domain has a small user community and a small set of business objects, so delegating all of the access rights controlled by the sample domain&#8217;s access policies does not affect performance. When setting up your access policies, we recommend that you restrict the number of access policies you make delegatable to protect your system&#8217;s performance. Decide which access rights are really critical and should be delegatable, and keep that number small. For more information about setting up access policies, see the subsection "Guidelines for Access Policy Setup" in the "Managing Policies" section of the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="SampleDomain-AccessPolicies"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-AccessPolicies"></a>Access Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access policies control self-service and delegated administrative access to DirX Identity&#8217;s resources (user and privilege data). An access policy defines a set of access rights to almost any object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two types of access policies: the type that restricts operations on specific objects - for example, "modify user" - and the type that restricts access to specific Web Center menus and menu items. To be able to work on an object, you must have the right to view and use the menu item that relates to managing the object and you must be allowed to manage the object; both of these access policy types must be set up correctly. For example, you can have the right to use the "modify user" menu, but if you are not allowed to manage any users, your rights to the menu are meaningless. Conversely, you can have the right to modify ten users, but if you are not allowed to use the "modify user" menu, you cannot search for these users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <strong>Policies</strong> view, click the <strong>Access</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> node in the tree. You can see three subtrees:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>_Queries</strong> folder. This folder contains a set of default query folders for access policies. The default queries here can help you to answer specific questions about access policies; for example, "Which access policies are active?" or "Which access policies are available for Users?". You can also define your own query folders either here or in your own domain-specific area to set up special queries for access policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Default</strong> folder. This folder is present in any domain. The access policies here provide basic access rights to DirX Identity user and privilege data for users and administrators. Target system groups (see the DirXmetaRole target system) are used to categorize administrator types; as delivered, the only member of each the group is the domain administrator (DomainAdmin). The policies in this folder are organized according to each object type: Accounts, Groups, Menus, Password Policies, Request Workflows and so on. Open some of these subtrees and then click on some of the access policies to read about what they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>My-Company</strong> folder. This folder contains additional access policies set up for the My-Company sample domain. These policies are organized into sub-folders that correspond to the operation they control: Approval, Create, Grant, Read and Modify, and so on.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All My-Company employees can use the <strong>Delegation</strong>, <strong>Self service</strong> and <strong>Work</strong> <strong>list</strong> menus in Web Center. These policies define the basic access rights of users in the sample domain. Open the policy <strong>Users have the Self service menu</strong>. In the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can see that the operation is <strong>execute</strong> and the protected object is a set of menu items (<strong>dxrMenuItems</strong>). If you go to <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Proposal</strong> <strong>Lists</strong> &#8594; <strong>Menus</strong> and then click on <strong>Self</strong> <strong>Service</strong>, you can see this menu definition. In the <strong>Subjects</strong> tab, you can see that the policy operates on a search for users in the My-Company part of the <strong>Users</strong> tree (the <strong>Persons</strong> <strong>Filter</strong> fields). In the <strong>Resources</strong> tab, you can see the set of menu items to which the policy applies: the <strong>Resources</strong> field provides the DN of the Self Services menu in <strong>Proposal</strong> <strong>Lists</strong>. The other two policies have a similar setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All My-Company employees in the Human Resources and Sales departments and all managers can use the user management menu. Open the <strong>Managers have the User Management</strong> menu policy. The operation (execute) and the protected object (menu items) are the same. The <strong>Subjects</strong> tab shows that the policy applies to a defined group - the <strong>allDepartmentManagers</strong> group defined in the DirXmetaRole target system (see <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> &#8594; <strong>DirXmetaRole</strong> &#8594; <strong>Groups</strong> &#8594; <strong>Templates</strong>). The <strong>Resources</strong> tab gives the DN to the set of menu items that correspond to the <strong>Users</strong> selection in Web Center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All My-Company managers can use the activity management and role management menus. These two policies also apply to the members of the <strong>allDepartmentManagers</strong> group and gives them the right to use the <strong>Role</strong> menu and context-sensitive selections in the <strong>Task</strong> <strong>list</strong> menu, like delegating an incomplete task to another user.</p>

<p>The <strong>setPassword</strong> operation means that the user can create and change the password, and the <strong>readPassword</strong> operation means that the user can see the value of the password if it is displayed in Web Center. The <strong>readPassword</strong> operation is intended for use with passwords of privileged accounts, which are functional accounts like "root" in a UNIX target system or "Administrator" in a Windows target system and are typically assigned to multiple users: When one user is removed from a privileged account, DirX Identity automatically changes the password and then propagates the new password to the target system. The other users who are still assigned to the account must then be able to look up and read the new password. The <strong>readPassword</strong> operation is intended for this use case when the sample domain configuration parameter <strong>Enable privileged accounts</strong> is set (see the <strong>Privilege</strong> <strong>Resolution</strong> tab at the domain). You can read more about privileged accounts in "Managing Target Systems" &#8594; "Managing Target System Accounts" &#8594; "Managing Privileged Accounts" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>All</strong> <strong>users</strong> <strong>can</strong> <strong>see</strong> <strong>tasks</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>all</strong> <strong>other</strong> <strong>users</strong> - enables all sample domain users to view the tasks assigned by request workflows of all other sample domain users. For example, any user logged in to Web Center can use <strong>Show tasks list</strong> to view the tasks assigned to a different user (provided there is a policy that allows the user to use the <strong>Show tasks list</strong> menu). You might want to change this policy to make it more restrictive (make sure you change the policy&#8217;s name if you change its meaning). For example, you could modify the policy to allow users to see tasks of other users only if they have the same department number by adding the following rule: <strong>$(subject.departmentnumber)="$(resource.departmentnumber)"</strong> (see the <strong>Rules</strong> tab of this policy).</p>

<p>View assignment policies allow you to control the visibility of privilege assignments and accounts and so hide sensitive information. To activate this feature, you must set the <strong>Enable view policies</strong> flag in <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Policies</strong>. If this flag is enabled, users can see by default all assignments of privileges.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sample policies exist for the sample domain:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal</strong> <strong>users</strong> <strong>can</strong> <strong>see</strong> <strong>some</strong> <strong>roles</strong> - enables My-Company internal employees to view the internal employee and contractor roles, since these roles represent low security risks. Click the <strong>Subjects</strong> tab. In the <strong>Persons</strong> <strong>filter</strong> fields, you can see that the policy applies to users and who reside in the My-Company part of the Users tree and whose <strong>employeeType</strong> properties are set to "internal". Click the <strong>Resources</strong> tab. In the <strong>Resources</strong> field, you can see that the <strong>Contractor</strong> and <strong>Internal</strong> <strong>Employee</strong> corporate roles are selected. When this policy is enabled, a logged-in internal employee of My-Company can view the internal employee and contractor roles, but he cannot view any other privileges. Users in the Customers and Suppliers organizations cannot view these roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal</strong> <strong>users</strong> <strong>can</strong> <strong>view</strong> <strong>all</strong> <strong>accounts</strong> - enables internal My-Company users to view all of the accounts in all of the My-Company target systems. Click the <strong>Subjects</strong> tab. In the <strong>Persons</strong> <strong>filter</strong> fields, you can see the same My-Company internal users settings as the other view assignment policy. Click the <strong>Resources</strong> tab. In the <strong>Resource filter</strong> fields, you can see that the policy applies to target system accounts (<strong>dxrTargetSystemAccount</strong>) of all the My-Company target systems (<strong>cn=TargetSystems,cn=My-Company</strong>). When this policy is enabled, My-Company internal employees can view all accounts in all target systems, but employees in Customers and Suppliers cannot see them. Note that you could create a more restrictive policy from this one by copying it and then changing the <strong>Search</strong> <strong>base</strong> field from allowing all target systems to be viewed to allowing only low-security target systems to be viewed (for example, cn=Extranet Portal,cn=TargetSystems,cn=My-Company).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be aware that using view assignment access policies can result in a user being unable to view any privileges or accounts. When implementing this feature, it is a good idea to create a view assignment access policy that gives an administrator the right to view all assignments and accounts.

<h4 id="SampleDomain-AttributePolicies"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-AttributePolicies"></a>Attribute Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attribute policy is a type of object policy that is used to track and control changes to specific attributes of specific object types. Click the <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> node in the Policies tree view. You can see two subtrees: <strong>Default</strong> and <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Default</strong> subtree contains the set of sample attribute policies provided with DirX Identity for specific object types like business objects, accounts, groups, and so on. These policies can be applied to any domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> subtree contains one attribute policy: <strong>User</strong> - <strong>Location</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Organization</strong> - that applies to the sample domain. Click it to display its properties. In the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can see that the policy is activated and an approval workflow <strong>Modify Location and Organization</strong> is selected. The purpose of this attribute policy is to prohibit unauthorized changes to a My-Company user&#8217;s organization and location values; these values are links to organizational unit and location business objects described in the "Business Objects" section. If you click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, you can see that the policy applies to the user object type (<strong>dxrUser</strong> is selected) and controls two user attributes (<strong>dxroulink</strong> and <strong>dxrlocationlink</strong>). As a result, any time a user&#8217;s organizational unit link (<strong>dxroulink</strong> in the policy&#8217;s <strong>Configuration</strong> tab; the value assigned to a user&#8217;s <strong>Organizational</strong> <strong>Unit</strong> property in the <strong>Users</strong> view) or its location link (<strong>dxrlocationlink</strong> in the policy&#8217;s <strong>Configuration</strong> tab; the value assigned to a user&#8217;s <strong>Location</strong> property in the <strong>Users</strong> view) is changed, the <strong>Modify Location and Organization</strong> approval workflow automatically starts to require approval of the change if the attribute modification approval flag is set at the domain level (see the "Request Workflow Parameters" section in "Domain Configuration").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add your own attribute policies; for example, you could add an attribute policy that protects a user&#8217;s manager attribute against unauthorized change. To set up and enable an attribute policy:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create the request workflow that will manage the approval process for the attribute policy (the easiest way is to copy the sample workflow and tailor it to your needs) and then activate it with the <strong>Is active</strong> flag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the attribute policy: specify the attribute(s) you want the policy to protect, the name of the workflow you created to handle the event, and activate it by setting the <strong>Is active</strong> flag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable the attribute policy at the domain level: set the <strong>attribute modification approval</strong> flag in <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>Request</strong> <strong>Workflows</strong> tab</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the overhead of attribute policy execution can affect your identity system&#8217;s performance and introduce a lot of complexity, we recommend that you protect only the most sensitive attributes in your environment from unauthorized changes. For more information on setting up attribute policies, see the subsection "Managing Attribute Policies" in the section "Managing Object Policies" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide.</em></p>

<p>A delete policy is a type of object policy that is used to track and control the deletion of a selected set of object types. The <strong>Delete</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> folder contains a default delete policy and a My-Company delete policy. Click the <strong>My-Company</strong> delete policy. It is identical to the default delete policy, but it has been activated (the <strong>Is</strong> <strong>active</strong> flag is checked). This delete policy protects roles and users in the sample domain from being deleted without approval. Click the policy, and then click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab. You can see the <strong>dxrRole</strong> and <strong>dxrUser</strong> object types are listed in the <strong>OD</strong> <strong>Names</strong> column. When a user or role is deleted, this policy ensures that an approval workflow is automatically started for approval of the deletion. For more information on delete policies, see the subsection "Managing Delete Policies" in the section "Managing Object Policies" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide.</em></p>

<h4 id="SampleDomain-EventPolicies"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-EventPolicies"></a>Event Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An event policy is a type of object policy that is used to track the creation of and changes to a selected set of object types. The <strong>Event</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> folder contains a default event policy and a My-Company event policy. Click the <strong>My-Company</strong> event policy. It is identical to the default event policy, but it has been activated (the <strong>Is</strong> <strong>active</strong> flag is checked). In this event policy, organizations, organizational units, users, and accounts in the sample domain have been flagged for event monitoring (context objects are also included in the policy for completeness, but are not activated for event monitoring). If you click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab and look at the <strong>OD</strong> <strong>Name</strong> column, you can see the object description names. As a result, a change to any object with one of these selected types or a creation of a new object of one of these types triggers an event-based workflow that stores information about the creation or change event for compliance purposes (in this list, you can see that the context object type <strong>dxrContext</strong> is set to <strong>false</strong>; which deactivates it from being monitored).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that because a single event policy allows you to specify all of the object types you want to track for events, you only need to have one event policy for a domain.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical areas</strong> - the password policy assigned to users or accounts that work with security-sensitive resources, for example, human resources or financial databases. In My-Company, all persons working in the General Management, Finances, Human Resources and Global IT departments are deemed to work in critical areas and thus have this special password policy assigned. For example, go to <strong>Users</strong> &#8594; <strong>My-Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Finances</strong> and click on <strong>Tinker</strong> <strong>Boris</strong>. Now click the <strong>Authentication</strong> tab. In <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Policy</strong>, you can see that <strong>Critical</strong> <strong>areas</strong> has been assigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services</strong> - the password policy assigned to "functional users" or "service accounts". The My-Company sample domain does not currently provide any examples of functional users. Note that the Services password policy does not specify an expiration time period, so the passwords of accounts that are assigned this policy will never expire. Companies often use this password strategy, but it&#8217;s not very secure. An alternative is to set a password timeout of 6 months, then notify an administrator about 30 days in advance that the password will expire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that all of these password policies have the maximum number of characters set to <strong>8</strong>. This setting is necessary for a centralized password scenario to accommodate target systems that cannot handle longer passwords (for example, a target system running UNIX).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The My-Company sample domain provides the following additional consistency rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cleanup inofficial memberships</strong> - this rule is intended to be used after a validation workflow run to enforce consistency between the external account-group memberships in a target system - in this case, the Windows Domain Europe target system - and the validated information about these memberships imported into the Identity Store. The rule checks the account-group memberships in the Windows Domain Europe target system and automatically removes any account-group memberships that are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transport mail attribute from account to users</strong> - this rule is an example of a consistency rule for managing attribute flow between external target systems and the Identity Store. The Windows Domain Europe target system runs a Microsoft Exchange server that manages Windows email addresses for accounts on that system. When you run a validation or an initial load workflow, this email information is brought into the Identity Store as an attribute of the imported account. This rule copies the email addresses defined in the external target system from the imported accounts, provisions them to the user entries in the Identity Store, and from there possibly to other relevant accounts in other target systems through the "master attribute" mechanism. For more information about this general process, see "Managing Attribute Flow" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>

<h5 id="SampleDomain-My-CompanyRole-BasedScenarioRules"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-My-CompanyRole-BasedScenarioRules"></a>My-Company Role-Based Scenario Rules</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we look at <strong>Role</strong> <strong>based</strong> <strong>scenario</strong>, we can see that it consists of a set of B2B and a set of corporate provisioning rules. Some examples are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Standard Customer</strong> rule, which assigns the <strong>Silver</strong> <strong>Customer</strong> role to all users under the <strong>dc=Customers,cn=Users,cn=My-Company</strong> subtree with <strong>employeeType</strong> set to <strong>Customer</strong>. The <strong>Standard Supplier</strong> rule is very similar to this rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Mercato Aurum = Platin</strong> rule, which assigns the <strong>Platinum</strong> <strong>Customer</strong> role to all Mercato Aurum employees (<strong>o=Mercato Aurum,dc=Customers,cn=Users,cn=My-Company</strong>). The <strong>TakeAway = Gold</strong> rule is similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Internal Employees</strong> rule, which assigns the <strong>Internal</strong> <strong>Employee</strong> role to all users under the <strong>o=My-Company,cn=Users,cn=My-Company</strong> subtree with <strong>employeeType</strong> set to <strong>Internal</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Signature Level 1</strong> rule, which assigns the <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>Level</strong> <strong>1</strong> permission to all internal users (<strong>o=My-Company,cn=Users,cn=My-Company</strong> subtree with <strong>employeeType</strong> set to <strong>Internal</strong>.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Access to Berlin - Data Center</strong> rule, which assigns the <strong>Berlin</strong> - <strong>Data</strong> <strong>Center</strong> group in the Physical Access target system to all internal employees who are located in My-Company&#8217;s Berlin office (<strong>l=My-Company Berlin</strong>). The other "Access" rules are similar to this one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="SampleDomain-SoDPolicies"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-SoDPolicies"></a>SoD Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the <strong>SoD</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> folder. It shows segregation of duty policies. (Some people use the term "separation of duty" instead.) The <strong>Default</strong> folder shows policies that can be relevant for any customer domain, while the <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> folder shows the policies that are only relevant for the sample domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> folder. Here you can see the SoD policies that can be used for the sample domain. For example, the SoD policy <strong>Contractor</strong> &lt;&gt; <strong>Manager</strong> specifies that My-Company contractors cannot be managers; that is, a user with the <strong>Contractor</strong> privilege cannot also have the <strong>Manager</strong> privilege. Should someone assign a conflicting privilege to a user, DirX Identity runs an SoD mitigation workflow that automatically notifies specific users (called "participants") about the SoD violation; these users may override the violation if necessary; DirX Identity will not assign the privilege unless the violation is specifically overridden. In the case of the <strong>Contractor</strong> <strong>&lt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> conflict, two company heads - Olivier Hungs and Gabriela Morton - are notified of the violation. One of these users must approve or reject the privilege assignment. Violations to a policy are stored below the policy in this subtree and in the user entry (see the <strong>SoD</strong> <strong>Exceptions</strong> tab). For a demonstration of the SoD process, see the follow-on tutorial "Applying SoD Policies".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use the sample SoD policies, you will need to activate them individually (check each policy&#8217;s <strong>Is active</strong> flag) and then check the <strong>Segregation of Duty (SoD) checks</strong> flag at the domain. You can read more about SoD policies and how to create them in the section "Managing SoD Policies" in the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="SampleDomain-RequestWorkflows"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-RequestWorkflows"></a>Request Workflows</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The My-Company sample domain provides a set of request workflows that are necessary for secure provisioning in My-Company. In the <strong>Workflows</strong> view, open the <strong>Definitions</strong> subtree. You&#8217;ll see a <strong>Default</strong> folder, a <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> folder and a <strong>System</strong> folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>System</strong> folder is the repository for standard, system-wide request workflows provided with DirX Identity. If you open it, you can see one request workflow named <strong>SendMail</strong> which is the standard workflow for sending email messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the <strong>Default</strong> folder. You will see a set of folders that contain the request workflows supplied with DirX Identity that can be applied to any domain. Customers who are setting up their own domains should evaluate whether or not these default request workflows apply to their environment, and then copy the workflows they want to use into their separate domain-specific area, change them to their requirements and then activate them for use by checking their <strong>Active</strong> flag. The section "Using Request Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> provides more details about these default request workflows and how to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> folder. You can see that the folder organization here is similar to the <strong>Default</strong> folder. The My-Company sample domain uses many, but not all of the default request workflows. It also provides the following request workflows that are specific to the My-Company domain:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Approve</strong> <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Self</strong> <strong>Services</strong> workflow in the <strong>Approval</strong> folder. This request workflow requests an approval of a Sales Manager when a customer uses Web Center self service to subscribe to privileges. It consists of an <strong>Approval</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> activity that contains the manager of the Sales Department, Ruben Briner (this is an example of a static approval definition). Users can only subscribe to the privileges available in customer self service if this person approves it. If he rejects the approval, the <strong>Notification</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>Rejected</strong> activity informs the user who is subject to the approval. The getting started tutorial "User Self-Registration" in this guide provides an example of this process. The subsection "User Self-Registration Workflows" within "Using Request Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> describes this type of workflow in more detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Physical</strong> <strong>Access</strong> workflow in the <strong>Service</strong> <strong>Management</strong> folder. This request workflow is an example of a manual provisioning workflow. It requests manual provisioning of the <strong>Physical</strong> <strong>Access</strong> target system, which manages access by My-Company employees to secured rooms. The follow-on tutorial "Using Manual Provisioning" in this guide provides an example of how to set up and use this manual provisioning workflow. The subsection "Manual Provisioning Workflow" within "Using Request Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> describes this type of workflow in more detail. The DirX Identity use case document "Service Management" provides more information on the service management concept in DirX Identity and how to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Modify</strong> <strong>Location</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Organization</strong> workflow in the <strong>Users</strong> folder. This request workflow is an example of an attribute modification workflow for controlled modification of a user&#8217;s attributes. This workflow is automatically started when someone changes a user&#8217;s location or organization attributes, which have been declared in the <strong>User</strong> - <strong>Location</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Organization</strong> attribute policy to be attributes that require change control (see the "Attribute Policies" section for details). The follow-on tutorial "Applying Attribute Modification Approval" in this guide provides an example of how to set up and use attribute modification approval. The subsection "User Modification Workflows" within "Using Request Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> describes this type of workflow in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="SampleDomain-TargetSystems"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-TargetSystems"></a>Target Systems</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My-Company uses a corporate network with two subnets in Europe and the U.S.A. The following figure shows an overview of the IT infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/502956161.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/502956161" width="447"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers and suppliers both have access to the Extranet Portal application. All internal employees and the contractors work with a set of applications mainly based on the Windows operating system. Information is provided by an Intranet Portal application. Some employees and contractors need to work with MVS or SAP R/3 applications. The central Identity Store provisions all of these target systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> view to view the target systems. They are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DirXmetaRole</strong> (type LDAP with no assignment states) - the standard target system with all the groups that are necessary for managing DirX Identity itself. There are no accounts in this target system; the users serve this purpose. Typical groups here are UserAdmins, who are responsible for user administration, and TSAdmins, who are responsible for target system administration. A set of template groups serves for special purposes. Here DirX Identity can automatically collect, for example, all department managers or all project managers. These groups can be used for specific provisioning or access policy tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extranet Portal</strong> (type LDAP with separate account and group trees) - a target system used for electronic data exchange of information between the Procurement department and the supplier companies and between the Sales departments and the customer companies. This target system contains groups to classify customers and suppliers and an Administrator group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intranet Portal</strong> (type LDAP with a common account and group tree) - a target system that provides information to specific groups of internal employees and contractors. This target system contains group portals, such as a Sales portal for the employees of the Sales departments and a Training portal for the employees of the Training department. Note that the accounts and groups in this target system are kept in one common subtree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MVS</strong> (type RACF with separate account and group trees) - this target system is used for software development and testing in the U.S.A. To keep it simple, all software development and all software test tools are collected in one group. In reality, having several groups makes more sense, especially when expensive licenses for the tools must be purchased. (Auditing and management of licenses is easy with DirX Identity. You always know exactly how many people use a specific license.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SAP R3</strong> (type SAP R3 UM with separate account and group trees) - this target system is comprised of several applications like HR (human resources), CRM (customer relationship management) and FI (finance application). For simplicity, only access to these applications is modeled. In reality, there might be specific roles for different people in each of the applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signatures</strong> (type Virtual) - this target system handles lists of three different signature levels. Level 1 is for all internal employees, level 2 for all managers and level 3 only for a few selected persons in general management. Virtual lists mean that there is no real target system representation that must be synchronized; as a result, this type of target system has no accounts and no assignment states. Perhaps the lists are printed and used by the Finances department to verify the signature level of an order. A better method is for Procurement to look up the signature level directly in the DirX Identity Store. The most sophisticated variant is that there is a special application that verifies the signature level automatically against these lists during an order workflow. If this application is, for example, the FI application, it can be modeled either as an associated target system or the lists can be modeled as groups in the SAP R/3 target system (it is not done this way in this example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows Domain Europe</strong> (type Windows 2000 with a common account and group tree) - this target system is the Windows 2008 domain in Europe. All European employees work in this environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows Domain USA</strong> (type Windows 2000 with a common account and group tree) - this target system is the Windows 2008 domain in the U.S.A. All U.S. employees work in this part of the My-Company network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical</strong> <strong>Access</strong> (type Request Workflow) - this target system is an example of an "offline" target system that is provisioned manually by an administrator through request workflows that are started automatically by real-time workflows, instead of being directly provisioned by DirX Identity Provisioning. In the sample domain, this target system manages physical access by My-Company employees to computer rooms in My-Company&#8217;s Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich locations that are secured with keyless entry systems. The follow-on tutorial "Using Manual Provisioning" in this guide demonstrates how to work with this type of target system. The DirX Identity use case document "Service Management" provides more information on the service management concept in DirX Identity and how to use it.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="SampleDomain-StatusReports"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-StatusReports"></a>Status Reports</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Status</strong> <strong>Reports</strong> tree is designed to provide a single (virtual) point of view for distributed status reports. Open the folder. You can see two folders: <strong>Default</strong> and <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Specific</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the <strong>Default</strong> folder. This folder contains the central report definitions that you can also find in <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reports</strong>. Now open <strong>Target</strong> <strong>System</strong> <strong>Specific</strong>. This folder is organized into target system-specific subfolders; each one contains the relevant <strong>Report</strong> folder for the target system, which contains the reports that are valid for this type of target system. For example, the folder <strong>Default</strong> &#8594; <strong>Target</strong> <strong>System</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> &#8594; <strong>Boston</strong> <strong>Workstation</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reports</strong> can be found under <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> &#8594; <strong>Boston</strong> <strong>Workstation</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reports</strong>. It contains the valid reports for the Boston Workstation target system type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reports in the <strong>Default</strong> folder and its subfolders are defaults that you can use, but do not modify them here because your changes will be overwritten with DirX Identity upgrades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now open the <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> folder. This folder refers to <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Extensions</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reports</strong> and is the location at which you can set up your own reports. To create reports for your domain, examine the status reports in the <strong>Default</strong> folder, copy the ones that apply to your environment into a separate domain-specific folder that you create in the <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> subtree, and then change them to your requirements. For information on how to customize the default status reports, see the subsection "Customizing Status Reports" in "Customizing Auditing" in the <em>DirX Identity Customization Guide</em>. There are no sample domain-specific reports, but there are a lot of default reports that you can use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under the <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> subtree, you can see a <strong>Target</strong> <strong>System</strong> <strong>Instances</strong> folder. If you open it, you can see a list of target system-specific folders that correspond to the sample target system types provided with the sample domain (see the "Target Systems" section for more information). You can use these subfolders to create reports for a specific target system in your domain: copy a default report for a target system type to the corresponding target system instance folder in your domain-specific part of the tree, and then modify it to your requirements. Your report is then also visible under the corresponding folders in <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> &#8594; <em>target system instance</em> &#8594; <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reports</strong>. Try creating some reports in the <strong>Auditing</strong> &#8594; <strong>Status</strong> <strong>Reports</strong> view and then check to see if they&#8217;re visible in the other views.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> subfolder that also appears in the <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> subtree. This subfolder is not operational and will be removed in a future DirX Identity release.</p>

<h4 id="SampleDomain-AuditTrail"><a class="anchor" href="#SampleDomain-AuditTrail"></a>Audit Trail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now open <strong>Audit</strong> <strong>Trail</strong> and then open <strong>Audit</strong> <strong>Policies</strong>. Here you can see three different subtrees:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong><em>Queries</strong> folder, which provides a set of default query folders for checking on active and inactive audit policies. For more information about queries, see the section "Creating a Query Folder" in the _DirX Identity Customization Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Default</strong> folder, which provides a set of default audit policies for objects that can be applied to any domain. These policies are samples and have not been activated (their <strong>Active</strong> checkbox is clear).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> folder, which contains the corporate audit policies for objects in the sample domain. The policies here are copies of the default audit policies that have been activated for use (their <strong>Active</strong> checkbox is checked) but are otherwise unchanged from the defaults. To enable them, check the flag at the domain configuration level (<strong>Enable</strong> <strong>Auditing</strong> <strong>for</strong> &#8594; <strong>Service Layer</strong> in the <strong>Compliance</strong> tab).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The procedure for using the default audit policies in your own domain is the same as for using default status reports and the other default DirX Identity objects: determine which default audit policies apply, copy them from the <strong>Default</strong> folder into your own domain-specific folder with the name of your domain, and then customize the copies to your requirements. Segregating your customizations from the <strong>Default</strong> folder allows you to preserve them across DirX Identity upgrades and provides a simple structure for synchronizing your customizations into your production system with the DirX Identity transport mechanism after you&#8217;ve tested them sufficiently. For information on how to set up audit trail and customize audit policies, see the subsection "Managing the Audit Trail" in the "Managing Auditing" section of the <em>DirX Identity Provisioning Administration Guide</em>.

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable</strong> <strong>access</strong> <strong>policies</strong> - when checked, this flag disables access policy handling (by turning off the DirX Identity Security Manager). You should only set this flag during testing because it allows all users to have access to all DirX Identity features. This flag is not set in the My-Company sample domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web</strong> <strong>Center</strong>/<strong>Enable</strong> <strong>view</strong> <strong>policies</strong> - when checked, this flag enables previously defined Web Center view assignment policies (if the individual policies themselves have been activated). View assignment policies control the privilege assignments and accounts that are visible in Web Center and DirX Identity Manager to different categories of users in the My-Company sample domain. If you check this flag, the view assignment policies provided with the My-Company sample domain will take effect. To examine these policies, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> view, click <strong>Policies</strong> &#8594; <strong>Access</strong> <strong>Policies</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>View</strong> <strong>Policies</strong>.

<li>
<p><strong>Approval content read-only</strong> - the My-Company sample domain does not set this parameter; approvers are allowed to change the data they are approving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User creation</strong> - the My-Company sample domain does not set these flags because they are not applicable to this scenario (the sample does not provide a Web Services setup in which a client triggers user creation from Web Services). Note that these flags are not relevant to Web Center; if it runs in the Business Suite, it creates users directly, and if it runs in the Professional Suite, it creates them using request workflows. Note, however, that you can customize Web Center to use the direct user creation mechanism as well as use request workflows when it runs in the Professional Suite.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The role parameter <strong>Project</strong> is defined in the view <strong>Domain</strong> <strong>Configuration</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong> &#8594; <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Extensions</strong> &#8594; <strong>RoleParams</strong> &#8594; <strong>My</strong>-<strong>Company</strong>. It references the My-Company business objects in the <strong>Business</strong> <strong>Objects</strong> &#8594; <strong>Projects</strong> tree. You can read more about these objects and their use as role parameters in the "Business Objects" &#8594; "Projects" section of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> roles subtree in the view <strong>Privileges</strong> &#8594; <strong>Roles</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Roles</strong> contains the roles <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> and <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>. Both roles use the role parameter <strong>Project</strong>. The match rule in each role&#8217;s <strong>Role</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab specifies that the <strong>Project</strong> parameter of the user-to-role assignment must be compared with the corresponding parameter of all group objects (dxrproject) that are part of all attached permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Specific</strong> permission subtree in the view <strong>Privileges</strong> &#8594; <strong>Permissions</strong> &#8594; <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>Permissions</strong> contains the permissions <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> and <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> that are used by the respective roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> permission has a match rule (click the <strong>Match</strong> <strong>Rules</strong> tab), which means it uses a combination of role and permission parameters. Click the <strong>Assigned</strong> <strong>Groups</strong> tab. You can see that there are two <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Management</strong> groups assigned to this permission. Click the <span class="image"><img src="_images/503283770/503480364.gif" alt="attachments/503283770/503480364"></span> icon to the right of each group and then click its <strong>Permission</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab. You can see that the <strong>Country</strong> field is different. It allows for the selection of one of these groups for U.S.A. and European users and illustrates group selection via permission parameter match rules. Note that the <strong>Projects</strong> permission parameter of these groups is set to "<strong><strong>", which means that they are independent of the *Projects</strong> permission parameter that is used for selection in the other groups. For example, look at the <strong>OptimizeIT</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> group. You will see that the <strong>Country</strong> permission parameter is set to "</strong><strong>" and the *Projects</strong> permission parameter is used for group selection from the role parameter.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> permission is also assigned to the groups <strong>HighPerformance</strong> <strong>Portal</strong>, <strong>MoreCustomers</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> and <strong>OptimizeIT</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> because a project manager is also a project member. Three manager groups are also assigned (<strong>Manage</strong> <strong>HighPerformance</strong> <strong>Portal</strong>, and so on). It is also assigned to the <strong>allProjectManagers</strong> group, which is part of a "grant" access policy implemented for My-Company. A project manager is automatically assigned to this group so that he is allowed to grant project-specific privileges to users. You can read more about My-Company access policies in the "Access Policies" section of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Member</strong> permission does not use a match rule. It uses the <strong>Projects</strong> parameter to select from the groups <strong>HighPerformance</strong> <strong>Portal</strong>, <strong>MoreCustomers</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> and <strong>OptimizeIT</strong> <strong>Portal</strong>, which are part of the Intranet Portal target system (see the view <strong>Target</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> &#8594; <strong>Intranet</strong> <strong>Portal</strong> &#8594; <strong>Accounts</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Groups</strong> &#8594; <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Portals</strong>. In this example, we assume that the complete management of projects is carried out through this Intranet Portal application. Each of these groups has the <strong>Country</strong> permission parameter is set to "<strong>*</strong>" and the <strong>Projects</strong> permission parameter set to a project-specific role parameter value.</p>
