<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUsers"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUsers"></a>Managing Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User management consists of two main tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date directory of the users to be administered with DirX Identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning privileges to users (controlling user rights) either by hand or automatically with policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Administrators carry out these tasks manually with the DirX Identity Manager or automatically with one of the workflows of the Connectivity view. Alternatively the Web-based interface Web Center can be used to assign privileges to users.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-MaintainingUsers"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-MaintainingUsers"></a>Maintaining Users</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User maintenance tasks include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding users, deleting users, and changing the attributes of users to be administered with DirX Identity, especially the attributes associated with user lifetime and deactivation periods (if DirX Identity masters the user data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronizing the DirX Identity user with a corporate directory master (if a corporate directory masters the user data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and maintaining user templates (if DirX Identity masters the user data)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-AssigningPrivilegestoUsers"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-AssigningPrivilegestoUsers"></a>Assigning Privileges to Users</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assigning privileges to users is the main administrative function in DirX Identity. In the DirX Identity Provisioning Configuration, the administrator controls a user&#8217;s rights by assigning one or more privileges to the user. DirX Identity then resolves the assigned privileges to the appropriate groups in the target systems (privilege resolution).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, DirX Identity Connectivity distributes the user-group relationships to the appropriate target systems (privilege distribution).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The administrator can also assign one or more privileges to a user template. In this case, DirX Identity stores the user-privilege assignment in its identity store, but does not perform privilege resolution and distribution until the administrator uses the template to create a real user.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUserFacets"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUserFacets"></a>Managing User Facets, Personas and Functional Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User facets, personas and functional users are special representations of users. A <strong>user</strong> represents a user in an identity management system. It is the main entry for this user and typically represents the personal accounts for this user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>user</strong> <strong>facet</strong> is an alternative representation of a user that reflects the user&#8217;s different positions in an organization, for example, a student who works as a teaching assistant and as a tutor. The "tutor" and "teaching assistant" user facets model the privileges that derive from his capacity as a tutor and a teaching assistant, while the "student" user facet models the privileges that derive from the user&#8217;s position as a student. The main user, meanwhile, models all of these privileges with the resulting accounts. The lifetime of the user object typically comprises the lifetime of all associated user facet objects, and the lifetime of a user facet object can be shorter than the user lifetime. The user facet object offers a way to model different functions for a user within a single organizational unit. User facets allow you to model multiple privilege profiles that share the same accounts as the user. A user facet is related to a user via the owner attribute. In contrast to a functional user, the user facet object normally changes its status with the corresponding user object and is not re-assigned to another user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>persona</strong> is an alternative representation of a user that reflects the user&#8217;s different functions in the company, for example, an administrator or a project manager. The accounts and the access rights for each representation may be quite different and auditing should be able to distinguish between the different representations for the user. The lifetime of the user object typically comprises the lifetime of all associated persona objects, and the lifetime of a persona object can be shorter than the user lifetime. The persona object offers a way to model different functions for a user that works in the same company but for different organizational units. A persona is related to a user via the owner attribute. In contrast to a functional user, the persona object normally changes its status with the corresponding user object and is not re-assigned to another user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>functional user</strong> is a resource that is assigned to an identity. Examples are a global or group mailbox, a physical room with a phone or a working student entry. The user either manages these resources or is responsible for them. A functional user is related to a user via the sponsor attribute. In contrast to a persona, the functional user can survive the user and must be re-assigned to another sponsor (user) if the current user is deleted or is no longer responsible for the resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figure illustrates the relationships between user, user facet persona and functional user objects:</p>

<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUserFacets"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingUserFacets"></a>Managing User Facets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since a user facet is a special representation of a user, maintaining user facets is closely related to maintaining users. User facet maintenance tasks include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding user facets, deleting user facets, and changing the attributes of user facets to be administered with DirX Identity, especially the attributes associated with user facet lifetime and deactivation periods (if DirX Identity masters the user facet data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronizing the DirX Identity user facet with a corporate directory master, if the concept of different user representations is also supported by the corporate directory (if a corporate directory masters the user facet data). Otherwise, only the user object is synchronized, and the user facet is maintained in DirX Identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning privileges to user facets, which you perform with same procedures and under the same rules as for user privilege assignment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingPersonas"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingPersonas"></a>Managing Personas</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since a persona is a special representation of a user, maintaining personas is closely related to maintaining users. Persona maintenance tasks include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding personas, deleting personas, and changing the attributes of personas to be administered with DirX Identity, especially the attributes associated with persona lifetime and deactivation periods (if DirX Identity masters the persona data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronizing the DirX Identity persona with a corporate directory master, if the concept of different user representations is also supported by the corporate directory (if a corporate directory masters the persona data). Otherwise, only the user object is synchronized, and the persona is maintained in DirX Identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning privileges to personas, which you perform in the same way under the same rules as privilege assignment to users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingFunctionalUsers"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingFunctionalUsers"></a>Managing Functional Users</h4>
<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingBusinessObjects"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingBusinessObjects"></a>Managing Business Objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use business objects to keep common information in a centrally located individual object rather than in individual user entries, where it can become inconsistent over time. Examples of business objects include organizations, organizational units, countries, locations, and projects. Business objects have many uses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use a business object to assign roles, permissions and groups referenced from the business object automatically to all linked users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use business object data such as "address" or "street" in linked user attributes and master this data at the business object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use business objects as sources for role parameters and proposal lists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Business object management consists of the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defining a set of business objects that help you to maintain an accurate and up-to-date directory of central data that can be used by user entries. DirX Identity delivers a set of default business objects that you can customize to your needs, and you can define your own types of business objects as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up event-based maintenance workflows that inherit privileges from business objects to users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up event-based maintenance workflows that propagate attribute changes from business objects to users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Setting up workflows to synchronize data from external data sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingTickets"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingTickets"></a>Managing Tickets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, DirX Identity processes updates to its identity management data immediately. For example, when an administrator changes a user&#8217;s department attribute, the change is applied right away (or when approval is obtained). In some cases, however, administrators may want to delay the application of a change and schedule it for a future date; for example, to process an employee transfer from one department to another. DirX Identity provides a built-in ticket system that allows administrators to specify the changes to an identity management object that should be made at a specified date in the future. The changes are then deferred and saved as temporary information in a ticket until the specified date arrives, at which point the DirX Identity Services layer processes them automatically. DirX Identity also allows for the integration of external ticket systems and provides other means for service management integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ticket management tasks generally include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating tickets in DirX Identity Web Center or Manager to schedule object changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing tickets to check their status and content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making changes to tickets to correct errors in ticket data</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingPolicies"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingPolicies"></a>Managing Policies</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DirX Identity supports different kinds of policies:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access policies, to control the access to objects in the Provisioning Configuration and for use for delegation and approval workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object policies for object related events, modification and deletion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules and operations, to automate consistency checks and perform automatic provisioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegations, to propagate access rights from one user to another one (optionally with a time restriction).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Policy management for access management and delegation consists of these tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding access policies, deleting access policies or maintaining access policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining which access policies can be delegated and which ones cannot be delegated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and maintaining delegations via the DirX Identity Web Center</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Policy management for consistency checking and automatic provisioning consists of these tasks:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Managing privileges (roles, permissions, and groups) involves setting up and maintaining the privilege structure; that is, the roles and permissions and the role-permission-group relationships. Role management tasks include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Segregation of duties - often called separation of duties or SoD - is a type of policy that can be applied to user-privilege assignments that constitute conflicts of interest and a mechanism for checking whether the privilege assignments granted to a user comply with that policy. The SoD policies define the conflicting privileges, while the SoD mechanism checks the user-privilege assignments for compliance with the policy and reports any discovered violations.</p>

<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingCertificationCampaigns"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingCertificationCampaigns"></a>Managing Certification Campaigns</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certification campaigns let you regularly certify user-role assignments. A campaign manager uses Identity Manager to set up a campaign. This task mainly involves defining the set of users to be certified and the start and end of the campaign. DirX Identity&#8217;s Certification Campaign Controller workflow automatically starts and monitors the campaign.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the start date is reached, the Certification Campaign Controller workflow creates a certification task for every user to be certified, determines the approver, and informs the approver via email. The approvers must either accept or reject each role assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the end date of the campaign is reached, the Certification Campaign Controller workflow removes all rejected assignments and notifies the affected users. The campaign manager can produce a report on the whole campaign.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand DirX Identity, it is important to understand the concept of "state" for the various objects (users, accounts, groups) and their interrelationship (account-to-group memberships).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>User states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persona states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of personas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional users states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of functional users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of account objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Role states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of role objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Permission states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of permission objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Group states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of group objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment states</strong> - the lifecycle and the possible states of account-to-group assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How privilege resolution works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between the user and the account lifecycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The descriptions of DirX Identity states given in this section use the following notation conventions to keep the state diagrams as simple as possible:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>dxr</strong> prefixes are omitted from the attribute names: we use StartDate instead of dxrStartDate and EndDate instead of dxrEndDate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual states are used. For example, if a user with a passed StartDate and a passed DisableStartDate is entered into the Identity Store, the user shortly reaches the ENABLED state due to the StartDate. Because the DisableStartDate is also passed, the state switches immediately from ENABLED to DISABLED. In this case, the ENABLED state is not stable, thus the result state is the DISABLED state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DirX Identity supports domain-specific timing parameters that control the setting of individual timing parameters at user, account and group objects. See the section "Timing" in the chapter "Domain Properties" of the context-sensitive help for more information about these timing parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several types of actors trigger the state transitions we describe in the next sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Administrators</strong> - Administrators perform actions via graphical user interfaces (DirX Identity Manager, DirX Identity Web Center). These actions result in requests to a built-in services layer that performs both simple and complex operations. An example of a simple operation is the change of a status attribute at a single object; an example of a complex action is a privilege resolution that may affect hundreds of objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services</strong> - Services are either triggered by administrators, by schedules or by an event. An example of a service is the User Resolution workflow. It checks and resolves users, which may result in state changes of the user object and other related objects. Another example is a policy workflow, which performs consistency checks on some objects that can result in state changes. As described earlier, services can be part of a user interface operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning workflows</strong> - Accounts and groups are representations of the real objects in the connected systems. The initial load / validation and synchronization workflows adjust the TSState attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the creation workflows should not set and handle user state attributes directly. Instead, they should set the timing attributes like StartDate, EndDate, DisableStartDate, DisableEndDate and the To Be Analyzed (TBA) flag. The TBA flag triggers services that evaluate the user object and set the user states. This procedure guarantees that the state machine is always the same and not dependent on a special creation workflow logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-UserStates"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-UserStates"></a>User States</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User objects represent active identity objects. Templates are inactive users that are not yet resolved. A user can have the following states:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TEMPLATE</strong> - the settings made for this user are used as a template for new users. Privilege assignments and attribute settings are not resolved for these user objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW</strong> - a new user that can be used for 'in advance' provisioning. The user does not have any rights in the domain because all accounts are disabled with no EndDate set. All necessary group assignments exist for all privilege assignments that are valid, but they are not activated due to the disabled accounts.<br>
Note: 'In advance' provisioning means that the administrators in the connected systems can perform all necessary additional preparative steps so that the user can work immediately when state ENABLED is reached. For a detailed discussion of this topic, see the section "How Privilege Resolution Works".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED</strong> - the user is established; the corresponding user object is up to date and valid, the privilege assignments are active.<br>
All corresponding accounts are set to state ENABLED.<br>
All necessary group assignments exist and are activated for all privileges that are currently valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED</strong> - the privilege assignments for this user are currently disabled, the user does not have any rights in the domain because all accounts are disabled. All necessary group assignments exist for all privilege assignments that are valid, but they are not activated due to the disabled accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TBDEL</strong> - the user object shall be deleted from the DirX Identity Provisioning system. This is done, when all assigned accounts in the connected systems are deleted or the end date for deletion is reached.<br>
Note: we chose to name this state TBDEL (to-be-deleted) instead of Deleted to indicate that the entry is assumed to be deleted but it still exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following user attributes are related to these states (the LDAP attribute is shown in parentheses):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>StartDate</strong> (dxrStartDate) - the date at which the user enters the company (activation of the user).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>EndDate</strong> (dxrEndDate) - the date at which the user leaves the company or when he is scheduled to leave (deactivation of the user).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DisableStartDate</strong> (dxrDisableStartDate) - the start date of a temporary deactivation phase (for example, a maternity leave).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DisableEndDate</strong> (dxrDisableEndDate) - the end date of the temporary deactivation phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DeleteDate</strong> (dxrDeleteDate) - the date at which a user in the TBDEL state is physically removed (the LDAP entry is deleted).<br>
Note: entries that still contain audit trail information are not deleted until this audit trail information is moved to an audit database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figure illustrates the user states and how they function in conjunction with the user attributes described here:</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure, the possible transitions are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) &#8594; TEMPLATE</strong> - a new user object created with the "template" flag set results in the state TEMPLATE. No privilege resolution is performed; that is, privileges that are assigned are not yet resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) or TEMPLATE &#8594; NEW</strong> - a new user object or a template whose StartDate is not yet reached enters the state NEW. A privilege resolution is performed but all newly created accounts enter the state DISABLED. All necessary group assignments are made for all privilege assignments that are valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) or TEMPLATE &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - a new user object or a template with StartDate reached enters the state ENABLED. A privilege resolution is performed and all newly created accounts enter state ENABLED. All necessary group assignments are made for all privilege assignments that are valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TEMPLATE &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - you can simply delete templates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - when the StartDate is reached, the state changes from NEW to ENABLED. The state of all relevant accounts is changed to ENABLED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW &#8594; TBDEL</strong> - when the EndDate is passed or an administrator deletes the entry with the user interface, the state changes from NEW to TBDEL. The DeleteDate of the user is set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeletaAnObject'. All accounts are set to state DISABLED, which results in inactive group assignments. The EndDate of all accounts are set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; NEW</strong> - this state change occurs if the StartDate is not yet reached. The state of all relevant accounts is changed to DISABLED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; DISABLED</strong> - this state change occurs if either the DisableStartDate is reached or the entry is disabled by an administrator via the user interface. The DisableStartDate is set to today if not yet defined.<br>
The state of all relevant accounts is changed to DISABLED. The EndDate is not set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; TBDEL</strong> - when the EndDate is passed or an administrator deletes the entry with the user interface, the state changes from ENABLED to TBDEL. The DeleteDate of the user is set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'. All accounts are set to state DISABLED, which results in inactive group assignments. The EndDate of all accounts are set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - this state change occurs if either the DisableEndDate is passed or an administrator enables the entry with the user interface. The state of all relevant accounts is changed to ENABLED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED &#8594; TBDEL</strong> - when the EndDate is passed or an administrator deletes the entry via the user interface, the state changes from DISABLED to TBDEL.<br>
The DeleteDate of the user is set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'. All accounts are set to state DISABLED. This results also in inactive group assignments. The EndDate of all accounts is set to 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TBDEL &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - an entry in the TBDEL state can be reactivated by setting the EndDate to a date past the current date. DeleteDate is reset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TBDEL &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - this state change occurs if the DeleteDate is passed (or this attribute does not exist) and the entry does not contain any audit trail information.<br>
All privilege assignments are removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A note about user and account lifetimes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accounts can exist for longer than their associated user. When the user reaches the TBDEL state, all the accounts change to the DISABLED state with an end date 'today + maximumTimeToDisableAnObject'. When the user&#8217;s DeleteDate has passed, the DirX Identity system physically removes it. When an account&#8217;s EndDate has passed, it switches to state DELETED with a new EndDate 'today + maximumTimeToDeleteAnObject'. DirX Identity only removes it from the DirX Identity Store when the corresponding account in the connected system disappears or its grace period defined by the EndDate is passed.</p>

<li>
<p>A user facet or a persona cannot outlive its related user.</p>

<p>As shown in the figure, the possible transitions of the account state are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) &#8594; IMPORTED</strong> - the initial load or validation workflows create new accounts in the target system in state IMPORTED. The TSState is set according to the state in the connected system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) &#8594; RESERVED</strong> - if the first group is assigned in the DirX Identity Manager, an account is created in the temporary state RESERVED to prevent the same account from being created in another application in parallel. If the group assignment is aborted, the account is deleted. If the group assignment succeeds, the state changes either to ENABLED if the user is ENABLED or to DISABLED if the user is in state NEW or DISABLED.<br>
Note: in DirX Identity Manager, the account state is always shown as ENABLED or DISABLED even if it is still in state RESERVED. In other applications (for example, Web Center), the state is shown as RESERVED.<br>
Note: due to a network error or an error in the account object description, the state can remain RESERVED. To solve this problem, find and correct the cause of the error and then re-run the privilege resolution service on the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist)</strong> or <strong>RESERVED &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - if the user is in state ENABLED and the first group is assigned, the account enters the ENABLED state, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist)</strong> or <strong>RESERVED &#8594; DISABLED</strong> - if the user is in state NEW or DISABLED and the first group is assigned, the account enters the DISABLED state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IMPORTED &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - if an account exists in the target system, the user is in state ENABLED and the first group is assigned, the account enters the ENABLED state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IMPORTED &#8594; DISABLED</strong> - if an account exists in the target system and the user is in state DISABLED or DELETED, the account enters the DISABLED state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IMPORTED &#8594; DELETED</strong> - if the account is deleted, it enters the state DELETED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; DISABLED</strong> - if a user is in state DISABLED or TBDEL, the account enters the DISABLED state (if the user is in state TBDEL, the EndDate of the account is set to 'today + maximumTimeToDisableAnObject'). If the resolution of an enabled user results in no assigned groups, the account is set to state DISABLED (the EndDate of the account is set).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; DELETED</strong> - if the account is to be deleted and the TSState is not DELETED, the account enters state DELETED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - if the account is to be deleted and the TSState is DELETED and there is no audit trail information present, the account is simply removed from the Identity Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - if the user is ENABLED and the privilege resolution assigns the first group, the account enters state ENABLED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED &#8594; DELETED</strong> - if the EndDate has passed, the account enters state DELETED. Alternatively, this state is reached if the account is deleted and the TSState is not DELETED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DISABLED &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - if the account is to be deleted and the TSState is DELETED and there is no audit trail information present, the account is deleted from the Identity Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DELETED &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - the account is deleted from the Identity Store if the EndDate has passed, TSState is DELETED and no audit trail information is still present.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The provisioning workflows control the account TSState attribute: they change its value to the current situation in the connected system as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>initial load workflow</strong> reads all entries from the connected system and imports them into the Identity Store. The state is set to IMPORTED and the TSState is set to ENABLED or DISABLED depending on the state in the connected system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>validation workflow</strong> reads all entries from the connected system and imports the changes to the Identity Store. Note that the initial load and the validation workflows are almost identical. The only difference is that the validation workflow writes a ToDo message in cases where the administrator must be notified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>synchronization workflow</strong> reads all necessary actions from the Identity Store, updates the connected system accordingly and then changes the TSState in the Identity Store. The synchronization workflows in the direction "connected system to Identity Store" usually operate on a delta-based scheme and therefore do not detect any unsolicited object deletions. Nevertheless, depending on the features of the connected system, the workflows may detect and acknowledge requested deletions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figures and tables show all account state combinations (State, TSState) and the possible transitions that can occur during the import operation at the Identity Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the figures, dashed lines indicate transitions that should not occur under normal circumstances but which can occur due to (illegal) administrator actions or other malfunctions. DirX Identity uses the dashed-line transition to solve the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the tables, bold states in the Resulting state / TSState column indicate that the state is changed.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the tables, the following columns indicate the following information:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Previous State / TSState</strong> - represents the State/TSState in the Identity Store before the workflow is run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connected system account</strong> - shows the state of the account in the connected system before the initial load / validation workflow is started or the TargetSystem &#8594; IdentityStore part of the synchronization workflow runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resulting State / TSState</strong> - represents the State/TSState in the Identity Store after the workflow completes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</ul>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example of how to read this diagram: the synchronization workflow reads all objects that are in state ENABLED and TSState NONE and then creates the corresponding accounts in the connected system. After successful creation, the TSState in the Identity Store is set to ENABLED, shown in the figure with the path ENABLED / NONE &#8594; Account enabled &#8594; ENABLED / ENABLED.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure, the possible transitions are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>(does not exist) &#8594; ENABLED</strong> - the initial load or validation workflows create new groups in the target system in the state ENABLED, set TSState depending on the state in the connected system and set the TsLocal Attribute is to true. Alternatively, an administrator can create a group by hand. In this case, the TSState is set to NONE and the TsLocal flag is reset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; DELETED</strong> - administrators can delete groups with TSState unequal to DELETED. The resulting state is DELETED, and the EndDate is set accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ENABLED &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - if an administrator deletes a group with TSState DELETED and there is no audit trail information available at this group entry, the group is physically removed from the Identity Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DELETED &#8594; (does not exist)</strong> - if the EndDate has passed, TSState is DELETED and there is no audit trail information available at this group entry, the group is physically removed from the Identity Store.</p>

<p>The provisioning workflows control the TSState attribute of groups according to the description given in the section "Account States".</p>

<p>The following figures and tables show all state combinations (State, TSState) and the possible transitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>In the figures, dashed lines indicate transitions that should not occur under normal circumstances but which can occur due to (illegal) administrator actions or other malfunctions. DirX Identity uses the dashed-line transition to solve the problem.</p>

<li>
<p>In the tables, bold states in the Resulting state / TSState column indicate that the state is changed.</p>

<p>The meaning of the columns is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Previous State / TSState</strong> - the State/TSState in the Identity Store before the workflow is run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connected system group</strong> - the state of the group in the connected system before the initial load / validation workflow is started or the TargetSystem &#8594; IdentityStore part of the synchronization workflow runs.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Resulting State / TSState</strong> - the State/TSState in the Identity Store after the workflow completes.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example of how to read this diagram: the synchronization workflow reads all groups that are in state ENABLED and TSState NONE and creates the corresponding group in the connected system. After successful creation, the TSState in the Identity Store is set to ENABLED. This is shown in the figure with the path ENABLED / NONE &#8594; group does not exist &#8594; ENABLED / ENABLED.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can assign privileges either by hand or via provisioning rules. You can also set a start date and an end date for a manual assignment to restrict its duration. After new privileges are assigned, (and if an optional approval is granted) DirX Identity performs a privilege resolution. The privilege resolution process collects the assignments from associated user facets and then calculates the actual memberships and the necessary accounts for the user depending on these assignments and their attributes.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-CalculatingAccount-To-GroupMemberships"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-CalculatingAccount-To-GroupMemberships"></a>Calculating Account-To-Group Memberships</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Account-to-group memberships can result from several sources, for example, a time-restricted user-to-group assignment or a role or permission assignment. The privilege resolution process calculates the duration period for each assignment. It can be defined for the future (period is FUTURE), it can be active (period is ENABLED) or it may have already passed (period is PASSED).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The privilege resolution process calculates the resulting period as a sum of all periods, where the priority is ENABLED &#8594; FUTURE &#8594; PASSED. It calculates the resolution result for the current time and sets the memberships accordingly (see below):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The resolution result is ENABLED if one or more of the assignments are in the ENABLED state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resolution result is in the FUTURE state if none of the assignments is in the ENABLED state but one or more assignments is in the FUTURE state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the resolution result is in the DELETED state.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-CalculatingAccountStates"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-CalculatingAccountStates"></a>Calculating Account States</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sum of the account-to-group memberships and the user&#8217;s state define the state of the account. DirX Identity supports "in advance" provisioning; that is, privileges can be assigned for a future period or the user can still be in the NEW state. With "in advance" provisioning, DirX Identity provisions the connected systems with all of the necessary accounts (but these accounts remain in the DISABLED state) and all of the necessary account-to-group memberships to enable the connected system administrators to perform advanced additional provisioning tasks if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The calculation procedure runs as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a user is in the NEW state, all accounts are set to the DISABLED state and all account-to-group memberships are set to state ADD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user is in the ENABLED state and has only "in advance" account-to-group memberships (period is FUTURE), the account is set to the DISABLED state. The account-to-group assignments are set to the ADD state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user is in the ENABLED state and has mixed account-to-group assignments (some are in period FUTURE and some in period ENABLED), the account is set to the ENABLED state and only memberships with period ENABLED are generated in state ADD. All memberships with period FUTURE are not generated in state ADD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user is in the ENABLED state, has only "in advance" account-to-group memberships (period is FUTURE) and one or more of these memberships enters the period ENABLED, the account is set to the ENABLED state.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>After creation of the user, the <strong>Start Date</strong> is not yet reached. The user is in state <strong>NEW</strong>. In this phase privileges can be assigned that are not yet active in the connected systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaching the <strong>Start Date</strong>, the DirX Identity services change the status automatically to <strong>ENABLED</strong>. Now all accounts and group memberships are enabled if the corresponding privileges are active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some period defined by a <strong>Disable Start Date</strong> and a <strong>Disable End Date</strong>, the user is in state <strong>DISABLED</strong>. This means that the corresponding privileges and accounts are not active in the connected systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaching the <strong>Disable End Date</strong>, the DirX Identity services change the status automatically to <strong>ENABLED</strong> again. Now all accounts and group memberships are enabled again if the corresponding privileges are active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>End Date</strong> is reached (the user leaves the company), the DirX Identity services change the status automatically to <strong>TBDEL</strong> (to be deleted). A complex procedure that can last months or years is performed that is explained in the next section in more detail. This time is defined by the <strong>End Date</strong> + <strong>Maximum time to delete</strong> (defined at the domain object).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The account lifecycle and the user lifecycle are closely related, as shown in the following figure:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until the user reaches the TBDEL status, the user is in status ENABLED. All associated accounts are in status ENABLED in the target systems of the Identity Store. The TS status in the target systems is also in ENABLED status. All related accounts in the connected system are also in ENABLED status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following steps are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the <strong>End Date</strong> is reached for the user entry (the user leaves the company), the DirX Identity services change the user status automatically to <strong>TBDEL</strong> (to be deleted). The <strong>Delete Date (User)</strong> is set to <strong>End Date (User) + Maximum time to delete (Domain)</strong>. Note that the <strong>Maximum time to delete</strong> is taken from the domain object.<br>
<br>
This results in immediate disabling of all accounts (state of accounts goes to <strong>DISABLED</strong>). The TS state is still in <strong>ENABLED</strong> state. The End Date of all accounts is set to <strong>End Date (User) + Maximum time to disable (TS or Domain)</strong>. Note that the <strong>Maximum time to disable</strong> is taken from the target system and if not available from the domain object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisioning (synchronization) workflows are run that perform the disabling in the target system (state of the accounts goes to <strong>DISABLED</strong>). If this operation is successful, the TS state is in the target system is set to <strong>DISABLED</strong> to reflect the state in the connected system. If these workflows are run scheduled, this can last some time. If the workflows are run event-based, the change happens almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Now the user is in state <strong>TBDEL</strong> and all account states are set to <strong>DISABLED</strong>, which means that the user is no longer active but not yet really deleted. This feature allows the user to be reactivated until the first account <strong>End Date</strong> is reached. The reason for this feature is that deleting the accounts instead of disabling them would mean that a reactivation of the user would require creation of the deleted accounts. In many systems, accounts have unique identifiers and security identifiers that are established by the connected system (for example, Active Directory). Creating an account again means that these identifiers are different. The user no longer has access to the resources he had before. So it is very important to keep the accounts in disabled state instead of deleting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the End Date of an account is reached, the DirX Identity services set the state to <strong>DELETED</strong>. In the target system the TS state is still in state <strong>DISABLED</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, a provisioning (synchronization) is run that deletes the account in the connected system physically. If successful, the TS state in the target system is set to <strong>DELETED</strong>.<br>
<br>
The user is still in state <strong>TBDEL</strong> and after the defined time (<strong>Maximum time to disable</strong> for accounts) all account states are set to <strong>DELETED</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleanup workflows (policy execution service with consistency rules) are run from time to time that try to delete accounts that are in state <strong>DELETED</strong>. If auditing is enabled, the deletion is only performed if all history information is removed from the entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleanup workflows (policy execution service with consistency rules) are run from time to time that try to delete users that are in state <strong>DELETED</strong>. If auditing is enabled, the deletion is only performed if all history information is removed from the entries.<br>

<h3 id="ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingAttributeFlow"><a class="anchor" href="#ManagingtheProvisioningSystem-ManagingAttributeFlow"></a>Managing Attribute Flow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important aspects of identity management is synchronization of attributes to provide a consistent view of identities all over the identity domain. The next figure shows how attribute flow is achieved through the identity system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/504463382/504201252.gif" alt="attachments/504463382/504201252" width="525"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, identity data for a user comes from a source system (for example, an HR system). As illustrated in the figure, the attribute flow steps are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <strong>Creation Workflow</strong> extracts the identity and its attributes from the Source System and transfers it to the Identity Store, where it creates the user entry. If attributes change, the Creation Workflow performs an update of these attributes. The Source System masters these attributes. For information on how to configure creation workflows, see the section "Configuring the Source Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If privileges are assigned to this user, accounts are created in target systems. In this example, Account A is created. You can use <strong>Naming Rules</strong> to transfer attributes from the user entry to the account. Naming rules are definitions within the attribute definition in the account object description. See the section "Properties and Property Elements" in the <em>DirX Identity Customization Guide</em> for more information.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning Workflows</strong> synchronize the account attributes to the corresponding account objects in the target systems. For information on how to configure Provisioning Workflows, see the section "Configuring the Target System Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Guide</em> for Java-based real-time provisioning and the section "Configuring the Provisioning Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> for Tcl-based provisioning workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this example, attributes that are created in target systems need to be distributed to other parts of the identity domain. A good example is an email address or a telephone number. The target system masters these attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation Workflows</strong> or <strong>Provisioning Workflows</strong> transfer these attributes to the representation of the account in the Identity Store. Validation Workflows update all accounts, whereas Provisioning Workflows only transfer information about specific entries that are handled during this synchronization. See the section "Configuring the Provisioning Workflows" in the <em>DirX Identity Application Development Guide</em> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>Consistency Rules</strong> to copy the changed attributes from the account entries to the user entries in the Identity Store. For information on how to configure these rules, see the section "Managing Automatic Provisioning". Note that the event-based workflows for example the EventBasedAccountProcessing workflow provide alternative means to handle such tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in Step 2, you can use <strong>Naming Rules</strong> to transfer these attributes to the accounts in other target systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning Workflows</strong> synchronize the account attributes to the corresponding account objects in these target systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Workflows</strong> can synchronize this information back to Source Systems.</p>
</li>

<p>This example describes attribute mastering from source and target systems. Attributes can also be mastered directly from user entries in the Identity Store. In this case, you use the Web Center or the DirX Identity Manager to maintain these attributes. The update processes are analogous to the steps described here.</p>
